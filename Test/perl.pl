#Program to calculate end to end delay.
#
#1. Program reads the trace file, finds for combination of 's' source event and 'AGT' packet type. 
#2. For this combination, the program takes the packet id and timestamp.
#3. Within the same file, the program searches for a combination of 'r' receive event and 'AGT' packet type.
#4. For this combination, the program takes the packet id and compares with previous packet id. If they are same, timestamp is noted.
#5. Difference between step 4 timestamp and step 3 timestamp gives the end to end delay for that packet.
#6. Delays are aggregated and average delay is found.
